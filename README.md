# Coding-Challenges (Cycle Through The Branches)

Here you'll be able to find all of my solutions for coding challenges that I've been asked or that I've done myself.

The best thing to do is to cycle through branches which is the main method of organization for this repository.

Each branch corresponds to which organization asked me the question or where I found it. 

Every file is an individual question with the original question commented out and my solution right after.
